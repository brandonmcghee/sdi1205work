<p>I decided to go with this story because it is a great memory of a summer day in young men's lives</p>
<p>I used a lot of variables in this to make sure that I covered at least the beginning of my story. Did not want to go into the full detail of the story just yet.  Maybe soon in the future on
our discussions boards or in another assignment.</p>
